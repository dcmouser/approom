# approom
NodeJS Server backend to facilitate multi-user communication and data synchronization using a room metaphor.

It includes much of the infrastructure of a CMS framework, including user authorization and authentication.

It could be used for providing a syncronization feature for applications, where each user group had a shared "room" under an app hierarchy; the api helps multi-device/user fetching and updating of common data.

It could also be used for multi-player games, where each game exists as a room, and room occupants broadcast and received information from the room.

In the past I have used the DropBox Sync API for providing a multi-device synchronization option for my Android apps, but dropbox as discontinued their sync API, and it never had the right granularity of access to support multiple users synchronizing from different accounts.

Early development, ignore this project for now.
