# approom
NodeJS Server backend to facilitate multi-user communication and data synchronization using a room metaphor.

It includes much of the infrastructure of a CMS framework, including user authorization and authentication.

It could be used for providing a syncronization feature for applications, where each user group had a shared "room" under an app hierarchy; the api helps multi-device/user fetching and updating of common data.

It could also be used for multi-player games, where each game exists as a room, and room occupants broadcast and received information from the room.

Early development, ignore this project for now.
