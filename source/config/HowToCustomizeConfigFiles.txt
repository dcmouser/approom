IMPORTANT: DO NOT EDIT THE "default.yml" FILE!
THIS IS THE BASE DEFAULT OPTIONS FILE THAT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN ON UPDATE.

INSTEAD, YOUR CUSTOM CONFIG FILES SHOULD BE IN THE ../../local/config/

----

From THAT ../../local/config directory:

Make a file defaultPrivate.yml with your PRIVATE local server settings.
Values in this file will override those in default.json
The .gitignore file will not share this private file so you don't share private information.

You can also create additional config .json files IN THAT /local/config directory
 and cause them to be loaded by passing commandline parameters to approom using the --config [FILENAME] options
