Make a file defaultPrivate.yml with your PRIVATE local server settings.
Values in this file will override those in default.json
The .gitignore file will not share this private file so you don't share private information.

You can also create additional config .json files here and cause them to be loaded by passing commandline parameters to approom using the --config [FILENAME] options
